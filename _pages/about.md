I am a first-year PhD student at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) working with [Professor Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/). I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. More specifically I have worked on projects related to text classification, semantic parsing and summarization, among others. 

In my spare time I am an avid basketball and Knicks fan and enjoy playing chess.
