        Discourse and Dialogue ([AugustÂ 2017).]{.date-range}
    -   **Winner of best paper award.**
    -   We explore whether modeling of conversation context helps in
        sarcasm detection and how we can understand what part of
        conversation context triggered the sarcastic reply using LSTM
        (Long Short-Term Memory) networks with attention.
