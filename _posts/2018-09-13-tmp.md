At least that's what I hope... In order to write better papers and familiarize myself with recent work, over the past month I made it my goal to read a new paper each day and take notes on each of them. I thought that this would be a useful way for me to better understand the papers and help others along the way. As Francis Bacon said, "some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested," and this is reflected in my notes. Additionally, the choice of papers was very subjective, with a bias towards recent work which is relevant to my current projects. The theme of October was summarization. Let's begin!
