# Introduction 

Welcome! If you've made it here, you are probably interested in Natural Language Processing \(NLP\) or a related field \( even if you're not, keep reading! \). If you are, I don't need to remind you how quickly NLP is growing, but here are two diagrams anyways:

<br>

| ![]({{ "/assets/imgs/nlp_search.png" | absolute_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| *A search of "NLP" returns over a billion results* |

<br> 

| ![]({{ "/assets/imgs/google_trends.png" | absolute_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| *Google trends for the term "Deep Learning"* |

<br> 


As a result, advancing in the fields of NLP and AI can seem daunting to the student or researcher. To help the growing NLP community and advance research related to NLP for educational applications, we introduced a new corpus in our paper "TutorialBank: Using a Manually-Collected Corpus for Prerequisite Chains, Survey Extraction and Resource Recommendation."

# What is TutorialBank?

TutorialBank is a manually collected dataset of over 5,600 resources on NLP as well as the related fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Information Retrieval (IR). We hand-picked high-quality resources over years related to these areas. These include tutorials, libraries, codebases among others. We feel that students learn a lot from reading tutorials in addition to academic papers, so we focus on resources other than papers. For each resource, we note meta-data such as the type of resource and categorize each one according to our own taxonomy of over 300 topics. 

# How can I use TutorialBank? 

Very easily! We created [a search engine](http://tangra.cs.yale.edu/newaan/) which we call "All About NLP" (AAN) and which you can use to easily search our corpus.  Our site also hosts the ACL Anthology Corpus and allows you to search over 24,000 papers and we are constantly expanding our corpus. You can explore our taxonomy and pick the type of resource you are looking for by clicking "Browse Resources by Topic:"

| ![]({{ "/assets/imgs/search_resources.png" | absolute_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| *In the mood to learn about Deep Learning? Look at all the resources we have for you!* |

<br> 

or you can just search for specific terms by clicking "Search Resources" as shown below:

| ![]({{ "/assets/imgs/search_lstm.png" | absolute_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| *I wish I had this resource before I did my homework on LSTMs...* |
