# Introduction 

Welcome! If you've made it here, you are probably interested in Natural Language Processing \(NLP\) or a related field \( even if you're not, keep reading! \). In that case, I don't need to remind you how quickly NLP is growing, but here are two diagrams just in case:

Advancing in the field of NLP and AI in general can seem daunting to the student or researcher. To help the growing NLP community and advance research related to NLP for educational applications, we introduced a new corpus in our paper "TutorialBank: Using a Manually-Collected Corpus for Prerequisite Chains, Survey Extraction and Resource Recommendation."

# What is TutorialBank?

TutorialBank is a manually collected corpus of over 5,600 resources on NLP as well as the related fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Information Retrieval (IR). We hand-picked high-quality resources over years related to these areas. These include tutorials, libraries, codebases among others. We feel that students learn a lot from reading tutorials in addition to academic papers, so we focus on resources other than papers. For each resource, we note meta-data such as the type of resource and categorize each one according to our own taxonomy of over 300 topics. 

# How can I use TutorialBank? 

Very easily!
